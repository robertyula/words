  <h1>Vimeo Plus Showcases Creativity to Creative People</h1>
  <body>
<p>Like you, I love watching and posting videos online. And also like you, 
I hate sitting through a gooey mess of pizza ads before, during and after every video. 
It's like trying to read a great novel in the middle of a carnival... on the tilt-a-whirl. Luckily, Vimeo Plus lets you watch and share high def videos without all the distractions and interruptions. 
Simply put, <strong>it's all about the content</strong>. It's not a carnival, it's a private theater - filled people just like you. 
People who are interested in content, not pizza advertisements.</p>

<p>But Vimeo Plus has a ton more to offer thanÂ clutter-free viewing. Get email support from an actual, real human in under 4 hours. 
That's right, Vimeo's technology is so advanced that it employs the use of <strong>actual human beings</strong> to service your needs. 
Upload up to <strong>260GB of HD video per year</strong>, with <strong>no duration limits</strong>. Hour long video? No problem. 
Two hours? No problem. If there somehow is a problem, Vimeo uses breathing, thinking humans who can fix said problem.</p>

<p>If you already use Vimeo, a Vimeo Plus upgrade gets you <strong>unlimited groups</strong>, channels and albums, 
so you can connect with more incredible people. Also, you get a sicko <strong>customizable player</strong> and advanced 
stats and privacy control.</p>

<p>If you're ready to watch and share high quality videos without commercial interruption and gain a world of useful tools and benefits, 
check out <a title="Vimeo Plus" href="https://vimeo.com/store/plus" target="_blank">Vimeo Plus</a>.</p>

<p>Unless you really like pizza.</p>
